To resolve this issue, ensure that the Android development environment is correctly configured. This includes:

1. **Install necessary Android SDK components:** Verify that all required SDK packages, build tools, and Android platform tools are installed and up-to-date.
2. **Check Android emulator settings:** Ensure your emulator is properly configured, including system image, hardware acceleration, and other relevant settings.
3. **Verify Android dependencies:** Confirm that all necessary dependencies for your project, including native modules, are correctly installed and linked.
4. **Clean and rebuild the project:** Sometimes, a simple clean and rebuild can resolve temporary issues related to the build process. Use the command `expo prebuild --clean` and then try again.
5. **Check your AndroidManifest.xml:** Examine this file for any issues or conflicts that might be causing problems with the installation.
6. **Update Expo CLI and related packages:** Running `expo upgrade` can ensure that you have the latest versions of Expo tools, which often include bug fixes.
7. **Use a physical device:** If the issue persists with emulators, test the app on a real Android device. This can help you isolate the issue to either the emulator or your code.
8. **Check for Errors:**  Carefully review the console output for any specific error messages during build and installation steps. This may provide clues about the root cause.
